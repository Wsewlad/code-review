# code-review

## My steps to complete this task
- Create github repo to simulate code review
- Clone repo to local machine
- Create file using bash command `touch MusicAlbums.swift`
- Open file and paste code from pdf documment using 'vi MusicAlbums.swift' command
- Open file using XCode to fix formatting (to be equal to the document)
- Decided just to add some suggestions in the file using `// TODO: - <comment>` syntax 

## Please, open MusicAlbums.swift file for my suggestions.
